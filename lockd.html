        <p class="title">What worked for me<p>
        <p>There were a few good subjects during this year's lockdowns (not a single one in particular):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>PE - we did nothing</li>
          <li>CED - again, no work, used it to catch up on my other subjects</li>
          <li>Digital Tech - as it is computer based anyway</li>
          <li>Social Studies - was just very well organised</li>
          <li>Science - we managed to complete an assesment on education perfect</li>
          <li>Languages - the way our classes were organised, they seemed to run themselves</li>
        <ul>
      </div>
      <div class="bodbloo" id="didnt">
        <p class="title">What didn't work for me</p>
        <p>There were quite a few more subjects that did not go so well:</p>
        <ul>
          <li id="list">Health - my teacher seemed to be under the impression we could do group work</li>
          <li id="list">English - we had various issues around where our work was actually supposed to be submitted</li>
          <li id="list">Mathematics - mathematics seems to always take up multiple periods due to the work set</li>
          <li id="list">Enterprise - not really good nor bad</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="bodbloo" id="goodteacher">
        <p class="title">The best teacher in lockdown</p>
        <p>Without naming anyone, I definetly enjoyed a certain teacher's class for it's organisation. Organising a class online less than 48 hours after a lockdown is certainly no easy feat. I can safely say not all teachers were up to the task. This teacher was able to give us new information just as well, if not better than in traditional classwork. I am (at the time of writing) about to take an assesment in this class, and feel that (despite the lockdown) I am perfectly ready.</p>

Also you will need to reload the page, as I did not have time to turn this into a toggleable function... (may do so at a future date). Update: I worked out how to do this, see bottom of homepage."
